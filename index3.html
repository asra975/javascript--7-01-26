                        engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side

                        Known for its Write Once, Run Anywhere capability, which means code written in Java can run on
                        any
                        device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
                        Syntax and structure is similar to C-based languages like C++ and C#.</p>
